# megacopy
This application is for DOS. It should compile with Turbo C 2.01. It copies files from one place to another and lets you retry / skip / quit if the operation fails. It's very handy for copying a directory tree off a harddrive onto several floppys.

This code is public domain.

A binary version is available here, it works on my IBM 286: http://files.zylinski.se/megacopy.exe
